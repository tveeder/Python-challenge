# python-challenge
BUDGET AND ELECTION DATA.  Python scripts for analyzing the financial records of PyBank and the election result of PyPoll.

# Project Description
Data analysis was performed on two different .csv files. The different python scripts can be found in the PyBank directory and the PyPoll directory. For the analysis, the .csv file is loaded into the script, the main.py script performs an analysis and prints a report to the console, and finally writes the report to a .txt file.


# PyPoll
Python script for helping a town modernize its vote-counting process.

Given two sets of poll data (election_data_1.csv and election_data_2.csv). Each dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.
